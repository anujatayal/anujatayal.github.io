# News Source

All news content is now managed from a single source: `_data/news_content.yml`

This ensures consistency between:
- About page news section
- News page
- Any other location that displays news

To add new news:
1. Edit `_data/news_content.yml`
2. Add new entry with date, content, and year
3. News will automatically appear everywhere

No need to maintain duplicate files!
