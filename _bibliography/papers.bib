abstract = {We propose a dialogue system that enables heart failure patients to inquire about salt content in foods and help them 
monitor and reduce salt intake. Addressing the lack of specific datasets for food-based salt content inquiries, we develop a 
template-based conversational dataset. The dataset is structured to ask clarification questions to identify food items and their 
salt content. Our findings indicate that while fine-tuning transformer-based models on the dataset yields limited performance, 
the integration of Neuro-Symbolic Rules significantly enhances the system{'}s performance. Our experiments show that by 
integrating neuro-symbolic rules, our system achieves an improvement in joint goal accuracy of over 20{\%} 
across different data sizes compared to naively fine-tuning transformer-based models.},
