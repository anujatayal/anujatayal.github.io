I am a Ph.D. Scholar at University of Illinois, Chicago under the supervision of [Dr. Barbara Di Eugenio]("https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/barbara-di-eugenio/") in the field of Natural Language Processing .

My research interests include solving various problems using NLP approaches. 
- Exploring Neuro-symbolic approaches for creating dialog systems
- Creating dialog systems for low-resource languages, with few-samples
- Creating healthcare dialog systems for the betterment of people
- Exploiting LLMs for data-augmentation and creating dialogs
- Use clarifying questions to create better dialog systems

I am always looking for interesting reasearch based internship opportunities. I always welcome the opportunity to collaborate and discuss my research. Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you're interested.
