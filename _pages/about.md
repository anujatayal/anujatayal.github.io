I am a Ph.D. Scholar at University of Illinois, Chicago under the supervision of <a href='https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/barbara-di-eugenio/' target='_blank'>Dr. Barbara Di Eugenio</a> in the field of Natural Language Processing .

My research interests include solving various problems using NLP approaches. 
- Exploring conversational architectures that deliver self-care information to African American patients with heart failure.
- Proposed a neuro-symbolic dialogue system to help heart failure patients monitor salt intake. 
- Examined different prompting strategies for LLMs to generate synthetic conversations in the absence of patient-oriented self-care dialogues.
- Conducted a user study with African American Heart Failure patients to understand how they perceive information by asking them to interact with 2 versions of dialog systems.
- Exploring different ways to combine the strengths of task-oriented dialog systems (TODS) and LMs/LLMs to create a hybrid dialog model.

<!-- - Exploring Neuro-symbolic approaches for creating dialog systems
- Creating dialog systems for low-resource languages, with few-samples
- Creating healthcare dialog systems for the betterment of people
- Exploiting LLMs for data-augmentation and creating dialogs
- Use clarifying questions to create better dialog systems -->

I am always looking for interesting reasearch based internship opportunities. I always welcome the opportunity to collaborate and discuss my research. Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you're interested.
